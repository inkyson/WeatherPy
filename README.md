# **WeatherPy**

## **Overview of the WeatherPy Project:**

In this project for PlanMyTrip app, we created a vacation destination and driving itinerary using input statements from our beta testers.  

## **Results:**

We successfully created a four cities driving travel route utilizing [Google Maps Directions API](https://jupyter-gmaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#directions-layer).

The destination cities were identified based on the beta testers' input statement of the minimum and maximum temperatures that they would like on their vacation.  The weather database was performed from an API call with [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
